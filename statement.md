# Introduction to Python

## What is Python ?
Python is a high-level programming language, with applications in numerous areas, including web programming, scripting, scientific computing, and artificial intelligence!

It is very popular and used by organizations such as Google, NASA, the CIA, and Disney.

## Printing text

Let's start off by creating a short program that displays "Hello world!".
In Python, we use the `print` statement to output text.

Syntax:`print("Something Here")`

```python runnable
print('Hello World!')
```

## Simple Operations

Python has the capability of carrying out calculations.

They are all similar to normal mathematical functions.

Some Basic Operators

`+`  Addition

`-`  Subtraction

`*`  Multiplication

`/`  Division

`%`  Modulus

Enter a calculation directly into the print statement:

```python runnable
print(2 + 2) # additions
print(5 - 3) # subtraction
print(5 * 5) # multiplication
print(25 / 5) # division
print(10 % 3) # modulus
```

## Comments 
Comments can be used to explain Python code, make the code more readable, prevent execution when testing code.

Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them.It can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line. 

```python runnable
# this is a new line comment
print("Hi,there") # this is a inline commment
#print("This print won't work")
```

Multiline Comments:
Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.

To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:

```python runnable
# this is 
# a 
# multiline comment
print("Multiline Comment")
```

## Variables

Variables are used to store information e.g. the variable age can hold the information about your age. You would use it like this: age = 18 . You can output a variable by using a function called print() e.g.: print(age)

```python runnable
age = 18 # change it to your age, if you want 
print(age)

# to print a variable
```
